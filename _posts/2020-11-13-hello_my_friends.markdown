Hello friends!

I had a blast making this project, I felt like I could see the fruits of my labors that Ive been putting in. I still feel very behind in a lot of my area but I have noticed that I do doubt my self and abilities in coding. My teacher, Ally is starting to understand that I just overthink it and lets me just process what I need and ill eventually get it. At the beginning that’s the hardest and most frustrating thing as a new student, I really felt lost. But now I see the benefits of why she would do that to me.

This project has opened my eyes to how powerful and how much there is to learn in being a web developer. I always knew that being web dev was hard but not to the point were you need about 20 lines of code for a simple button set up hah. 

I am learning that I love front end web development don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing yet because im really trying to get the highest return in a job with the skills I have but the dress up and making things look cool is where I feel like I  can spend hours and be so happy.

Thanks flatiron for another stress project week it was worth it:)here.
