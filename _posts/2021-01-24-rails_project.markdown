I really did love rails!

I learned so much I felt with rails because 1. It was an expansion of Sinatra which it was nice to refresh for one and go deep with such similar databases. 2. I felt like so much was do-able with rails, I may not be a strong coder but I did feel capable to do a lot.

I wish I had more time in this module to actually dive deeper into the material and consume more because I felt like I still barely know what rails can really do. This module really push my limits in so many ways, in the last 2 months has been hectic in my personal life and I had to do a lot of catching up through out this whole module and then project week hit and I began by making a domain that didn’t work for the project and spent over a week trying to make it work then crunch time happened and I watched everything.

I do love the organization of rails and learning more about DRY coding maybe its my OCD but that was just nice to place everything where it belongs and know everything has a place and it doesn’t have to be cluttered. But my weakness in learning this is associations that is my downfall, I don’t know if my mindfully understand the directions when you start associating but its nice to learn these weaknesses and not let it intimidate me in the future cause in the end I do figure it out.

I do love coding but its hard hah.
