FOR THE MONEY!!!

In all honesty I didn’t even know software engineering was a career path you go to school for till I was a senior in college. My senior year in college I had some friends in there computer sciences classes and I never spent the time to ask about the kind of classes they were taking until I saw one writing code while I was over at his house watching. I always assumed the way you learned to code was when your were young and you played with computers and learned on your own and that how it worked. But one day after college I ran into an old friend from high school and found out he become a full stack developer and is working for a company. And I started feeling like the words “coding, developer, software engineer, ECT...” 

Then after hearing about it for so long, maybe like 3 years, I finally starting looking into my self see if it possible started talking about it with friends and one friend said she has been wanting to do something different so we started to look and found flatiron. I felt like things were moving fast once I start I found the school and talked to a recruiter to give me information about the school I then started hesitating. And started thinking, “do I want this, why do I want this” and  the pros started weighing out the cons. More opportunities, return on investment, better work/life balance, normal hours, and just a quality of life and I couldn’t give it a con that had enough weight to say no. And I took the plunge. And here I am writing my paper on why I chose this route:).
