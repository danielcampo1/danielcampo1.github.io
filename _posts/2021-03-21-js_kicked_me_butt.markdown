WOW…. Let me tell you about my Javascript experience.. it was a hot mess! I was super excited at the beginning of this module to start of with front end bc I thought I wanted to be a front end developer but a lot of life stuff happened between school, work, weather, family this module that put a stop to be able to enjoy school and learning the way I wanted. Yes, I understand life will always happen and we prioritize the things we want but it sucks when you don’t feel supported when your drowning. this project was tough bc I still don’t feel like I understand JS I changed my project about 4 times to maybe get the MVP. It took all the way to Sunday to only get about 100 lines of code..

	but enough of the negative, with changing my code so much I did start to learn and understand the flow of JS, that basically there is no flow. Not like rails atleast, I appreciated the structure rails provided. But JS is basically the developers idea of flow is how it works. I like how it requires a creative mind set but as someone starting to learn I just would have liked a bit more structure hah but what are my options with that? i think it finally hit me how powerful and light weight JS is during the last couple days of my projects when things were kinda working that a one page applications is a perfect user friendly language. The coolest part was playing with json and serializers, but I hated how the errors with JS are just to nice I need to know what I did wrong. But overall I still want to learn more and more about JS it seems like I barely uncovered about 2% of it.
