The content of your blog post goes here.Has this project just been a wake up call to everything I didn’t know. I am going to be very honest in this blog because quite frank, I don’t think anybody is really reading this but also bc its very real and I need to take a second and discuss what I really think about this project. 

Where do I start, this started off with the first day of this project watching and reading everything that this CLI project and what would it take to complete. After reading all the necessary requirements regarding the project, in all honesty after watching Avi’s video on scraping his “deals” I thought to myself this will be a breeze. Everything he did I had some kind of understanding for and no way did I think this would take me the full two weeks. OH, WAS I WRONG!

I first made the mistake and wasted 2-3 days just telling myself I was going to plan everything I wanted my code to do, that was me just being lazy and not actually sitting down and starting the code. I didn’t attend any office hours that were accessible to me. It was probably Thursday, when I finally sat down to actually begin some kind of code and I felt like my head just went blank..

When I began coding,  I felt like i was so used to the spec files from our learn assessments that if something didn’t work I was pretty good at looking at the error and correcting it from there and really utilizing my AAQ. That was my second downfall because all those things were taken away from during a project. I felt like I had to copy off people’s code on how they made there CLI to just begin (don’t worry I didn’t end up really coping). But it was a really bad feeling when you waited till Thursday night to finally begin your project you finally show up to your teachers office hour Friday morning to just make fake data to have a CLI kinda working. But on the weekend I was on my own no teacher, no AAQ, nobody to respond to me in slack.

On Saturday and Sunday of this project I become so stress out that I couldn’t get anything working I didn’t fully know what I wanted to do either, but remember I just wasted those days earlier in the week to finally have a couple days off from being signed on. And when I become stressed I shut down bc my body doesn’t know how to coop with stress.. was a good sign that weekend in all honestly I ignored my project on the weekend as well.

But come Monday I was hungry, I was ready to to start the ball rolling and I got lucky with work and requested a whole week off last year bc I was suppose to be on vacation during this project week but COVID changed that but now with a whole week off of work I can just be a student and immerse myself to this project. I showed up to every office hour this week I made multiple meeting with my teacher to break down what I want to do and how to do it.

Honestly those meeting are too short.. 20 minutes really doesn’t benefit me enough bc in those 20 minutes it really just one question that gets answered and for beginners those 20 minutes is just spent explaining something that you fully didn’t understand from the assessments and Maybe you’ll get to your code to make it work and nothing further.. maybe that was helpful to people but, for me it felt like I was two steps behind and the meeting put me back at ground zero.  I just wanted a little on the uphill side. Just stating my opinion. 

After really buckling down in 5 days and hours upon hours spent not coding. Wait what do you mean not coding but you spent hours? Well let me tell you, there was a lot of little thinking that I wasn’t prepared for that wasn’t taught in the curriculum like how to set up a repo, or a bundler, or how to trouble shoot in gem.spec files so you can use necessary thing that your project that you have been assigned like Nokogiri. Or how to even push your code into your GitHub from your terminal. I spent so much time outside of my project that should have been used coding and when you pay so much money for a school and they don’t teach you the basics of how to use a GitHub or at the least pushing your project into it so you can turn it in. 

At the end of the project I did have to shorten it for timing and deadline sake. But I did learn a lot and felt like the training wheels of spec file and AAQ  finally fell off. I will learn from my mistake and start as soon as possible.
